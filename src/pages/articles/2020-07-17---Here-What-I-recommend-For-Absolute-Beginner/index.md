I am a Data Engineer at Deerwalk, Inc. As a Data Engineer, I ensure that right data fields are mapped to company standard fields using the ETL process on healthcare data from varying sources (Eligibility, Medical, Pharmacy, LAB, Vision) and layouts and preparing analysis reports for data validation.
 It's been more than two years that I am working in the Healthcare Domain and work has been way monotonous than ever. Therefore, I wanted to enhance my skills in the data domain. I found out that
Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a Data Science career.

It's been months that I had started to learn Python.

## Here are a few Dont's for the beginners.

* Losing Focus:

* Copying Code:

* Referring to tutorial Videos:

I tried not to do those mistakes and my coding skills have improved a lot. I assure you it will help you guys as well.

Here are some of the resources, that I have referred to in order to learn the basics for python.
