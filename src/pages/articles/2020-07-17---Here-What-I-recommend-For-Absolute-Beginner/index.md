I am a Data Engineer at Deerwalk, Inc. As a Data Engineer, I ensure that right data fields are mapped to company standard fields using the ETL process on healthcare data from varying sources (Eligibility, Medical, Pharmacy, LAB, Vision) and layouts and preparing analysis reports for data validation.

It's been more than two years that I am working in the Healthcare Domain and work has been way monotonous. Therefore, I wanted to learn and enhance new skills. I found out that Python is one of the valuable skills needed for Data Science. Thus I have started coding.

It's been months that I had started to learn Python.

## Here are a few Dont's for the beginners.

* Losing Focus:
In the beginning, while taking the online course, I was so dedicated to complete my course but after that, I kind of lost my track. It's had been a week, I had not written a single code. Since I have a full-time job it was easy to make an excuse. And I want to master my coding skills.

Enough was enough! I dedicated at least 3 hours for coding for the morning. I stick with this no matter what which helped me to improve my coding.  

Social media is one of the biggest mediums that distracted me a lot. To avoid this I chose not to keep my phone in front of me while coding. I suggest other people as well.

* Copying Code:
This is an absolute no-no! No matter what do not copy the code of others.  I used to watch tutorials and copy the exact code they had written. I did that for months. After months of copying thousands of code, I was still not confident enough to write the code of my own.
Thus, I suggest trying at least to code on your own first. I know it is time-consuming but it's worth it. This will help you to progress quickly.

* Referring to tutorial Videos:

Tutorial videos are easy and it's a human habit to prefer ease right? If I am stuck in any problem I used to would directly to Youtube and search for my problems. This habit of referring to videos only should be avoided. You should start referring to an article or stack overflow instead this will improve your debugging skills as well. Sometimes you can though.

I tried not to do those mistakes and my coding skills have improved a lot. I assure you it will help you guys as well.

Here are some of the resources, that I have referred to in order to learn the basics for python.
