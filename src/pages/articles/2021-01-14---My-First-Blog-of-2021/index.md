Hi people, it's been so long that I had not written a single blog. Now onwards, I will be journaling about the things that I have learned to be a full stack developer once a week.

 For this blog, I will be writing about my 2021 resolutions for my career.

My main goal for 2021 is to become a full-stack developer. And there is a reason behind it. I have this dream project that I want to lunch and build a company. I am very optimistic that my idea will be a huge success. And I need to work and take action to make it happen under any circumstances.

I have already started to work on this project with the help of my friends. And I am very grateful for their support. But I feel like I am not contributing enough to my project. So I have decided to learn to code and build this project.

The project that I have been blabbing about is a clothing website. Believe me, people, this is not just an inventory site. It is more than this. We will be building this site using Python language in the Django framework. I have already learned the basics of Django, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and JavaScript. I know Python as well. From today onwards, I will be dedicating at least 5 hours beside my office work to achieve my goals. I will be sharing about the journey on my Youtube channel as well. I will be sharing about the resources that I have learned from and mistakes that I have made in my journey so that you can learn from them. Let's get started.

I hope I will be proud of myself in 2022. Happy New Year!!!

Hope this project will be useful for you guys as well
