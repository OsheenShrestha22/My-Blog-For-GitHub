I am Osheen Shrestha and I live in Lalitpur, Nepal. I have pursued my bachelor's degree in computer science from Deerwalk Institute of Technology, and currently working as a Data Engineer in Deerwalk Company. I started to work in the Health domain sector since 2018.

I am very passionate about Data and Health domains. I have computer skills that include knowledge of Python, Django, GitHub, and MYSQL.

I wanted to enhance my coding skills especially Python and communication skills. That is why I have started to blog. And in this blog, I will be posting about the things that I have learned so far and I hope that might be useful for you as well. Your feedback will be highly appreciated.

Besides coding and writing, I love to dance, explore new places and reading novels. Dan Brown is one of my favorite writer so far. And recently I have been into posing for my Instagram
